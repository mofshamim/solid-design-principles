## SOLID Design Principles
SOLID refers to five core design principles that promote software maintainability, scalability, and robustness. These principles guide developers to create software that is easier to understand, modify, and extend.

**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- Each class should have only one responsibility or reason to change.

**Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.

**Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
- Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

## Benefits of SOLID Design Principles

**Improved Maintainability**
- Code is easier to read and understand.
- Modifications can be made without breaking existing functionality.

**Enhanced Scalability**
- New features can be added without extensive changes to the existing codebase.

**Better Testability**
- Code designed with SOLID principles is modular, making unit testing straightforward.

**Reduced Coupling**
- Loose coupling between components makes the system more flexible and adaptable.

**Improved Reusability**
- Well-defined responsibilities and modular components enable reuse across different projects.

**Facilitates Team Collaboration**
- Clearly defined responsibilities make it easier for team members to work on different parts of the codebase.

By following SOLID principles, developers can create software that is more adaptable to changing requirements, while reducing technical debt.
